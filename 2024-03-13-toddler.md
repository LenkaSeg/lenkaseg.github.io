# How to run toddler pdc_import_compose.py locally and get the payload obtained from koji that is to be pushed to pdc.

There are three places in the code that do the push:
- two inside the function `_import_compose`:

```
pdc["compose-images"]._(
    {
        "release_id": release_id,
        "composeinfo": composeinfo,
        "image_manifest": images,
    }
)
```

```
pdc["compose-rpms"]._(
    {
        "release_id": release_id,
        "composeinfo": composeinfo,
        "rpm_manifest": rpms,
    }
)

```

- one inside the function `ensure_release_exists`:

```
 pdc["releases"]._(release_payload)
```

What I need is to check what the payload pushed to pdc/compose_images and pdc/compose_roms is while making sure nothing gets pushed there for real.

To solve this, I will run a local server and redirect the post requests to the localhost.
First considered option for testing/sending data across network connections, netcat, I was not able to make POST work
`nc -l -p 8080 POST /post`

Checking another option: [httpbin](https://httpbin.org/)
Running httpbin in a container as described in the documentation (inside toddlers vagrant VM):

`docker run -p 9000:80 kennethreitz/httpbin`

Rewriting the post requests to point to localhost/9000:

```
data={
    "release_id": release_id,
    "composeinfo": composeinfo,
    "image_manifest": images,
}
requests.post("http://localhost:9000/post", data=data)
```

and

 ```
data={
    "release_id": release_id,
    "composeinfo": composeinfo,
    "rpm_manifest": rpms,
}

requests.post("http://localhost:9000/post", data=data)
```

and in `ensure_release_exists`:

```
requests.post("http://localhost:9000/post", data=release_payload)
```

From another window inside the vagrant, I will run the toddler I'm interested in:

`python3 -m toddlers.plugins.pdc_import_compose toddlers.toml 818affe5.txt`

In the toddlers.toml config all of the urls are chanded to point to stg for additional safety, but the rest of the requests should be only GET.

Now I see how the POST requests look like, while not posting anything anywhere, but the problem is, that the payload is not visible, I see only "payload" in the request. How to actually see what the payload is?

Setting logging on DEBUG mode, modifying http.client to debuglevel=1, stuff I found on stackoverflow that worked for other folks:

```
import http.client

http.client.HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1

logging.basicConfig()
logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
_log = logging.getLogger(__name__)
requests_log = logging.getLogger("urllib3")
requests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
requests_log.propagate = True
```

But does not really work for me, I still see only "payload".
And what about to use good old print after the post request, to see what it is trying to push? (Heh, could have this idea a slight bit earlier)

Adding `print(f"Compose-images data: {data}")` after the request and now I get a lot of data printed (and forwarded into a file, from where I split it into two files, image-compose and rpm-compose, removing the header lines and such).
Would be nice to see it with some json viewer. `jq` is complaining it's not really a json format. Turns out it doesn't like the single quotes, so turning them all to double quotes. The image-compose is not that voluminous, so it's easy to change it in vim: `:%s/\'/\"/g`
The second file, rpm-compose keeps crashing vim, in vi better, but still I cannot manage to make the swap. Trying `sed`, but can't escape the quotes well. Finally trying `cat single-quoted-file.txt | tr "'" '"' | tee double-quoted-file.txt` and that works well. jq is still complaining about one `False` without quotes, adding quotes and jq finally pretty prints it. The output is too large to see on the terminal, so opening it in firefox to see the structure.

And I see the structure well now.
