## What is Outreachy?

[Outreachy](https://www.outreachy.org/) provides 3-month internships to work in Free and 
Open Source Software (FOSS) - as you can read on Outreachy front page. It is intended to
people chronically underrepresented in tech.

There two rounds each year, in the winter and in summer. It's very easy to apply. 
The first step is to fill the eligibility form and wait for approval.

Once approved, the applicant can see all the projects available with descriptions and 
required sets of skills. I picked a project which corresponded with my skills and also 
just sounded good to me - Fedora's Create CLI tool to interact with Pagure pull-requests 
API. [Pagure](https://pagure.io/pagure) is a main Code Review system for Fedora community.

## My Outreachy winter 2018 project

The Pagure community is very friendly and helpful. I got a lot of help with my first 
shaky contributions and with getting into the workflow. I felt very comfortable asking 
even beginner's questions and got the answers quickly. My mentor, Alexandra Fedorova, pointed 
me to more project-related issues and provided documentation.

I applied to this project and luckily, it was approved. So happy!

Currently my task is to research on other CLI tools, their features and interface. 
Also, to get familiar with [Click](https://pocoo-click.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and 
start writing the new project with simple functionality. More details about my task I'll 
provide in my next post.
